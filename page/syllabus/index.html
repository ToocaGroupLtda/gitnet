<p>This course introduces students to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/knowledge-integration/node/1">Knowledge Integration</a>. It compares the diverse ways of knowing, producing, and organizing knowledge across the disciplines. We will also cover analytic skills that are useful in all types of knowledge work, and start developing effective research and writing habits. Please note that this course emphasizes collaborative learning. Group discussions will usually take place at the beginning of the class, followed by any lecture material at the end. When I lecture, it will mostly be to explain difficult concepts or aspects of the readings that are not addressed in group discussion. Finally, most of the writing you do will be shared with the class using the team collaboration tool <a href="https://slack.com">#Slack</a>.</p>

<h1 id="learning-outcomes:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Learning Outcomes</h1>

<p>I am currently rethinking the learning objectives for this course. Stay tuned.</p>

<!-- By the end of the course, students should be able to:   -->

<!-- 1. Compare how data is created, used, analyzed, and interpreted in the life, physical, and social sciences, and the humanities
2. Describe the central issues in public policy making about collecting, archiving, sharing, and reusing data
3. Characterize the limitations of common-sense thinking for complex problems in the social sciences and humanities
4. Explain how social and information networks shape expert knowledge
5. Learn fundamental rules of composition
6. Start developing good writing habits by writing multiple drafts, and by writing regularly in small amounts -->

<h1 id="assignments-deliverables:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Assignments / Deliverables</h1>

<p>I am currently revising the assignments and deliverables in this course. The final version will be posted here my approximately mid-August.</p>

<p>Close to the start of the term, you will be able to download a calendar file (<code>.ics</code> format) with the due dates for course deliverables.</p>

<h1 id="readings:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Readings</h1>

<!-- This class introduces research design, data collection, and data analysis in quantitative and qualitative research. While there are many excellent books that do one or two of these things well, I am not aware of any book that does them *all* well. Therefore, we will read selections from a variety of research methods textbooks *and* a number of carefully chosen journal articles that use methods covered in the course.  -->

<p>There are three required books for this course. One is free.</p>

<ul>
<li>Duncan Watts. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004DEPHGQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Everything is Obvious Once You Know the Answer</a></em>.</li>
<li>Donella (Dana) Meadows. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557">Thinking in Systems: A Primer</a></em>.</li>
<li>Ali Almossawi. <em><a href="https://bookofbadarguments.com/AIBOBA-white.pdf">An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments</a></em>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submitting-work-late-policy:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Submitting Work &amp; Late Policy</h1>

<p>You will submit all work electronically in the general channel on #slack <strong>and</strong> on LEARN. <strong>You may not submit hard copies or Microsoft Word documents under any circumstances</strong>. Please submit PDF files instead. I will deduct <strong>5 points</strong> a day for every day, or part of a day, that your work is late, including weekends. I will not make exceptions without a medical note.</p>

<h1 id="communication:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Communication</h1>

<p>We will be using the collaboration tool slack for all class communication. Of course you are free to email me, but I tend to respond to slack messages from students faster than I respond to emails. Sign up with and sign into slack by going to <a href="http://www.slack.com">slack.com</a>. There are slack apps for Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. If you are a Linux or Windows user, there is a very good web app.</p>

<h4 id="feedback:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Feedback</h4>

<p>I will solicit brief, informal, and confidential course evaluations three or four times throughout the semester. These will only take a few minutes of your time. The purpose is to make sure that we are moving at a comfortable pace, that you feel you understand the material, and that my teaching style is meeting your needs. I will use this ongoing feedback to make adjustments as the course progresses. Although you are not obligated to do so, please fill out the evaluations so that I can make this the best learning experience for you, and the best teaching experience for me.</p>

<h1 id="on-campus-resources:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">On Campus Resources</h1>

<h4 id="the-writing-centre:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">The Writing Centre</h4>

<p>Although I will be giving you feedback on your work throughout the term, I encourage you to make appointments with people at the writing centre. Their services are available to all UW students.</p>

<h4 id="access-ability-services:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Access Ability Services</h4>

<p>The AccessAbility Office, located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the AccessAbility Office at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

<h4 id="mental-health:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Mental Health</h4>

<p>The University of Waterloo, the Faculty of Environment, and our Departments consider students&rsquo; well-being to be extremely important. We recognize that throughout the term students may face health challenges &ndash; physical and / or emotional. Please note that help is available. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. Counselling Services is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more.</p>

<h1 id="university-policies:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">University Policies</h1>

<h4 id="academic-integrity:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Academic Integrity</h4>

<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility.</p>

<p>We will all uphold academic integrity policies at University of Waterloo, which include but are not limited to promoting academic freedom and a community free from discrimination and harassment. You can educate yourself on these policies &ndash; and the disciplinary processes in place to deal with violations &ndash; on the Office of Academic Integrity website.</p>

<p>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic offense, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about &lsquo;rules&rsquo; for group work / collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate Dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline. For typical penalties, check Guidelines for Assessment of Penalties.</p>

<h4 id="grievances-and-appeals:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Grievances and Appeals</h4>

<p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his / her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70: Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4. When in doubt please contact your Undergraduate Advisor for details.</p>

<p>A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70 &ndash; Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71 &ndash; (Student Discipline) may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72 (Student Appeals).</p>

<h4 id="religious-observances:051025d606153e159a2b11ffecb897d5">Religious Observances</h4>

<p>Student needs to inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and deliverables.</p>
